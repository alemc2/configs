# configs

Most configs are pretty much copy paste of the configs in this folder. The only
exception is vim.

For VIM do the following:
* Copy the config files to the appropriate location.
* Install autopep8 for python lint
* Start up a neovim instance
  - It should automatically download the dein github repository.
* run `:call dein#install()`
